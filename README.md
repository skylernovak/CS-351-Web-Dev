For my programming tool, I have selected VS Code. It is a fast, lightweight code editor with heavyweight funtionality. It has the following features:
+ IntelliSense - intelligent code completetion that learns from you and your code
+ Built in debugging - no more print line debugging!
+ Built in Git - compare diffs, stage files, commit, push, pull all from right in VS Code
+ Extensible - many extensions! If it doesn't come with the language you want, get the extension!

You can get VS Code [here].
