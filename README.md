# Assignment Outline for CS351

The following is explanatory text and should be removed from any submissions.

## Introduction

In CS351 and other web related classes that I teach we use GitHub as the mechanism to turn in assignments. Each student gets their own private GitHub repository that is shared with the instructor and possibly a TA or grader.

## README.md

All homework submissions are via commits to the students repository where the `README.md` forms an important part of your assignment solution. This file is written in *Markdown* and rendered as a nice HTML page by GitHub so I can easily check your submissions.

The following shows the outline of a typical assignment solution. You will need to use this general format for your submissions.

# Homework #N Solutions

## Question 1 (Headings and Screenshots)

Use level 2 headings `##` in *markdown* which translates to `<h2>` in HTML for each question.

### (a)

If the question has a subpart use a level 3 `###` heading in *markdown* which translates to `<h3>`.

### (b)

Many times you'll be asked to suppy a screen shot of your work. You'll use a screen capture program and save in a `png` or similar format in a subdirectory of your repository. *Markdown* makes it easy to include images.

Here is an example screen shot showing a browser window and developer tools:

## Question 2 (Code Samples)

Other questions may ask you to show a specific section of your code. You will submit nicely formated and syntax highlighted code with the help of *Markdown* (and GitHub rendering). Do **not** submit a *screen shot* of your code in these cases!

### (a) JavaScript Example

Don't worry about what this code does. It is the formatting that counts.

```javascript
  let hourStart = hourParser("07:00");
  let hourEnd = hourParser("21:00");
  const yScale = scaleTime([hourStart, hourEnd], [vpad + h, vpad]);
  yScale.clamp(true);
  let dayWidth = (xScale(dateEnd) - xScale(dateStart)) / (endInd - startInd);
  // Draw tide block rectangles for the days
  for (let i = startInd; i < endInd; i++) {
    let currentBlocks = currentDays[i];
    for (let block of currentBlocks.blocks) {
      svg.append("rect")
        .attr("width", dayWidth);
	}
  }
```

### (b) CSS Example

Here is some CSS highlighted:

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
	font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
	
}

body {
	padding-left: 1em;
	padding-right: 1em;
}

details {
	max-width: 40em;
	border: solid black;
	padding: 0.5em;

}
```

### (c) HTML Example

Some HTML nicely highlighted:

```html
<body>
	<p>Starting date: <input type="date" id="DatePicker" min="2019-01-01", max="2019-12-17" ></p>
	<section>
		<div id="CurrentViz1"></div>
		<div id="CurrentViz2"></div>
		<script src="./currentViz.js"></script>
	</section>
</body>
```

## Question 3 (Links)

Other questions may ask you to provide a link. Typically to one of your deployed websites on the CS server computer. Markdown makes providing link easy, but you **must** ***check*** your links. Broken links will **not** receive any credit for that portion of the assignment!

Here are some example links:

1. A React application I wrote used in teaching advanced networking classes: [ComNetViz](https://www.grotto-networking.com/ComNetViz/ComNetViz.html).

2. A React application used to show sailing logs and GPS tracks: [Windsurfing Grotto](https://windsurf.grotto-networking.com/#/about).

3. A ficticious club website from a previous semester with useful tide information for foiling: [Bay Area Windsurf Foiling Club](https://bawfc.grotto-networking.com).
